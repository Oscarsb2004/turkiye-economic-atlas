"""
atlas.datasets — the code each dataset card names (docs/REBUILD.md §3).

A card in registry/datasets/ says which builder makes a dataset: a function
here, `module:function`. A builder reads through the acquire shells, shapes
records, runs its checks, and RETURNS what it made. It never writes: the runner
(`atlas/run.py`) writes the published files, only when their content changed,
and the frames and receipts beside them. One writer is what makes "a re-run
leaves a zero-line diff" a property of the project rather than of each stage.
