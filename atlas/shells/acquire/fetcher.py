atlas.shells.acquire.fetcher — the one way this project talks to the internet.

(Moved from atlas/net.py in step S2 of docs/REBUILD.md; unchanged in behaviour.)

Every outbound request goes through `Fetcher`. That is worth enforcing because
the alternative — `requests.get` scattered across four source modules — is how a
scraper ends up hammering a government site during a debugging session, and how
politeness settings drift apart between modules.

Four behaviours, each with a reason:

  Rate limit. canada.ca's robots.txt sets no Crawl-delay and disallows nothing
  we touch, so ~1 request/second is self-imposed rather than required. It costs
  about a minute for a full MPO crawl and removes any question of whether we
  were a burden.

  On-disk cache, WITH A TTL. Development means running stage 01 dozens of times;
  without a cache that is dozens of full crawls of a public service for no new
  data. But an unexpiring cache silently defeats the thing the cache exists
  alongside: `data/history/` only appends when a page's content hash moves, and
  a permanently cached page's hash never moves. An immortal cache therefore
  turns change detection off without saying so.

  So entries expire (default 24h). Repeated runs inside a working session are
  free; a run the next day sees what the government changed. `--refresh`
  bypasses the cache entirely for the case where you know something just moved.

  Backoff. 502/504/524 from these hosts are infrastructure, not a bad URL.
  Three retries with exponential backoff; 404 and 403 fail immediately, because
  retrying them just repeats a wrong answer more slowly.

  Generous timeouts. canada.ca was observed taking more than 45 seconds to first
  byte from some networks while smaller endpoints answered instantly. A short
  timeout would turn that into a spurious "site down".

Explicitly NOT carried over from African-Stability-Index: that project's
`01_pull.py` monkey-patches `requests.Session.merge_environment_settings` to
force `verify=False` process-wide as a Windows SSL workaround, and tracks it in
its own backlog as a defect. TLS verification stays on here. If a corporate
proxy ever breaks it, the fix is REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE, not disabling the check.
