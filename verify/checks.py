"""
verify.checks — run the checks declared in `registry/checks.yaml`.

THIS MODULE MUST NOT IMPORT `atlas`. See `verify/run.py`.

Every check in here is generic over a dataset's declared shape. Nothing knows
that the Major Projects Office has `sites`, that a site's geometry holds
`coordinates`, or that projects are called projects — those are strings in the
registry. Adding verification for a second event is a YAML entry; only a new
KIND of question needs a function here, registered in `KINDS`.

THE PATH LANGUAGE

Dotted, with `[]` meaning "every element of this array":

    name.en                     one value
    sites[].geometry            one value per site
    sites[].geometry.coordinates[]   one value per coordinate, per site

Resolution always returns a LIST, even for a single value, so a caller never
has to branch on whether a path fanned out. A path that does not resolve
returns an empty list rather than raising: a dataset that declares no geometry
skips the geometry checks, which is what lets one registry describe events that
are not shaped alike.

`expect_from` is the same idea pointed at a registry file:

    events.yaml:events[slug=major-projects-office].expected.projects

The `[field=value]` selector picks one element of an array by a field's value,
so the reference survives someone reordering the events list.
